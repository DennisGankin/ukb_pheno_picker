# UKB Data field picker


Tool to help extracting tabular data from data fields in the UK Biobank.  

The **Streamlit app** offers a simple browser based app, to easily search for available data fields in the UKB and retreive the corresponding field ids in a table. This is based on the schema provided in the UKB showcase.  

The **data extraction script** extracts the chosen data fields from the UKB data. Needs to be run on the UKB platform. Similar to the [Table exporter](https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/app/table-exporter) app.
